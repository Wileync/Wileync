# Wiley N. Carlin
My name is Wiley, and I’m a high school student at Golden High School in Golden, Colorado. I’ve proudly played varsity football and varsity track and field for two years, building resilience and teamwork along the way. With a business-driven mindset, I aspire to pursue a career in sales, where I can connect with people, build relationships, and learn from those I admire.

Faith is at the center of my life. I believe that Jesus Christ is my Savior, and I strive to reflect His light in everything I do. I approach life with optimism, always offering a smile and maintaining a positive outlook.

Academically, I excel in math and have a solid foundation in computer science. I attended Warren Tech in Lakewood, Colorado, for a year-long, half-day Computer Science and Cybersecurity program. Through this experience, I’ve completed numerous coding and networking assignments, gaining hands-on technical knowledge.

I’m proficient in Python and have developed a deep understanding of AI technology — how it works, how to apply it, and its potential to solve problems. My exposure to both the technical and human side of innovation has fueled my appreciation for technology and its role in shaping the future.

As I continue my education, I aim to grow not only in my technical abilities but also in my capacity to communicate and collaborate. Every interaction is an opportunity to learn, and I’m committed to making meaningful connections along the way.
